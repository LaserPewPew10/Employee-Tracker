# Employee-Tracker

![Demo](Readme.gif)


This command-line application manages a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

To deploy this on a live system, copy all of the files to your computer. This is a command-line tool, not one that runs in the browser. There are no live pages to demonstrate.

You can see these tests run by viewing the provided animated GIF file
